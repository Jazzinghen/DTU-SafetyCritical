/** \brief Function used to compute the Lookup Table for the decoding.
 *
 *  The idea is simple: we generate the position of all the possible errors (up to 3 bits, however, since
 *  over that quantity it's not possible to do a proper correction) and then we store them in the
 *  Lookup Table using the syndrome generated by the errors as index. These are stored in an array of
 *  Unsigned 32-bit integers.
 *
 *  This function checks also if there is already a Lookup Table File. If this is the case it loads
 *  the Lookup Table in the array. On the other hand, if the file does not exist, then the Lookup Table
 *  is computed and stored both in an external file and in the array.
 *
 *  Bear in mind that it doesn't check whether the file has a correct Lookup Table or not, so if there's
 *  any suspicion that the file is wrong/corrupted simply eliminate it and the function will generate a new
 *  one.
 *
 *  \param message:     Wheter we want some informations printed on screen or not. Either MESSAGES_ON or MESSAGES_OFF
 *  \param LookupTable: Pointer to the Decoding Lookup Table
 *
 *  \return The result of the file operations inside the function.
