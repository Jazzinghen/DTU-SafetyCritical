This is the project for the “Safety-Critical Embedded Systems” course at DTU.
It's a simple implementation of the Binary Golay Code, which is a perfect error
correction code for 24 (or 23) bits codewords with up to 3 wrong bits. We
implemented both the standard version and the LookUp Table based version.

I'll put here the data I've gotten from the benchmarks.

Average time to compute and write on disk the two Lookup Tables, computed on 10k
consecutive generations and writings:
  
  1283458.546 ns

Average time to read the two Lookup Tables from files, computed on 10k
consecutive readings:
  
  86832.1155  ns
